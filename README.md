# Nginx Project

This project is a Node.js application configured to work with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites
ff
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Nginx

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nginx-project.git
    cd nginx-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Configure Nginx:
    - Open the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`).
    - Add the following configuration:
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
    ```

2. Restart Nginx:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    ## Usage

    1. Start the Node.js application:
        ```sh
        node server.js
        ```

    2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to ensure the application is running.

    3. If everything is working correctly, you should see your application being served through Nginx at `http://yourdomain.com`.

NGINX vs Apache: Web Server Comparison
Introduction to Web Servers
NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") and Apache HTTP Server are the two most popular open-source web servers powering over 60% of websites worldwide. While both serve similar fundamental purposes - delivering web content to visitors - they differ significantly in architecture and optimal use cases.

Core Components Compared
NGINX Components
NGINX Core Functions

Request Processing: Handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently

Web Server: Optimized static content delivery

Service Proxy: Advanced reverse proxy capabilities

Application Integration: Seamless connection to app servers

Apache Components
MPM Modules: Flexible processing models (prefork, worker, event)

.htaccess: Directory-level configuration

Dynamic Modules: Extensible functionality

CGI Support: Traditional dynamic content handling

Enterprise Deployment

Key Differences Summary
Aspect	NGINX	Apache
Architecture	Event-driven, asynchronous	Process/thread-based
Performance	Excellent for static content	Better for dynamic content
Configuration	Centralized	Distributed (.htaccess)
Resource Usage	Lightweight	More resource-intensive
Use Cases	Modern web apps, microservices	Traditional web applications
When to Use Each
Choose NGINX when you need:

High performance static content delivery

Reverse proxy/load balancing

Microservices architecture support

Kubernetes integration

Choose Apache when you need:

.htaccess flexibility

Shared hosting environments

Legacy application support

Dynamic module loading

Both servers continue to evolve, with many organizations using them in complementary ways - NGINX as a reverse proxy in front of Apache application servers.
